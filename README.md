Having a job is the main dream for those who are still studying in college or those who have graduated. But the competition for getting a job has become even harder. Thus, it makes many people try their best luck to get a job in another field which is not aligned with their major. Based on Kompas.com, the minister of education, culture, research, and technology (Mendikburistek) stated that around 80% of Indonesians have a job not aligned with their major. Coming from this situation, our team decided to make an application that helps users find the job that best fits them. Some research questions we need to answer to overcome our problem are: what parameters are considered when searching for a job? How can we know that some jobs are suitable for some people? The reason why our team decided to make this model is because we are concerned about some people who have not got a job. After all, they keep trying to get a job that is aligned with their major. But in the meantime, many people get a job which is not even related to their major at all. We try to help those people find a job which may not align with their major, but that job still suits them.

1. Machine Learning: building machine learning for predicting jobs based on user inputs of their major, years of job experience, and skills. Our model reaches 97% accuracy on training. We saved our model in .h5 format and deployed it to the Google Cloud Platform made by cloud computing cohorts.
2. Mobile Development: Create a user flow and design the UI/UX based on the user flow. Then, implement the design into code using Kotlin and XML in Android Studio. Additionally, create an interface for communication between the app and server using Restful API and Retrofit library in the MD section.
3. Cloud Computing: implement the Job Recommendation Application mechanism using backend and node.js. create a logging dashboard, then go to the profile, and then enter study program data and work experience period.
